GGPLOT PROJECT PROPOSAL

Objective: Repurpose WQ plot from base graphics to ggplot

Client: Jim Bloom and the Coquille DO TMDL

Description: A few weeks ago, we looked at some scripts for plotting in base graphics.
This project will convert one of those plots to ggplot2. This conversion will include
all processing and analysis of raw data to arrive at a reasonable facsimile of the
original product.

Basic rules:
1)	Project resources (volunteers):
    a.	Project manager
    b.	Wo-R-ker Bees (git it?)
2)	Each bee will be assigned a random roster number to determine the task assignment order.
3)	First task: PM organizes project into however many discrete tasks. This doesn't need to
    be done alone
4)	Each bee will have a turn at working on the task according to the assigned order.
5)	Bees work on that task for 30 minutes then hand off to the next rostered bee.
6)	Bees have two days to begin a task, otherwise hand off to the next rostered bee.
7)	The roster rolls over a task until it is complete.
8)	When a task is complete, the next person on the roster begins the next task.
9)	After each person is done with their task assignment, the solution is posted to GitHub
    using Colin’s step-by-step for Status and Trends.
10)	The subsequent worker bee has to use whatever portion of code developed by the previous
    worker bee(s). You can’t just scrap the solution and start over, unless the solution
    patently does not work. This will be managed by the PM.
11)	Comment, comment, comment. Make sure to leave instructions or ideas for the next person.
12)	Obviously you’re not required to do this-—you have deadlines or are simply recalcitrant—-
    but your level or effort will determine the size of your participatory trophy*!

* There are no participatory trophies.
